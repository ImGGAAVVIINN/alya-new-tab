## Explanation of permissions:

- **Storage**: Used to store your settings in the browser's storage area.
- **Replace the page you see when opening a new tab**: Used to replace the New Tab page with this extension.
- **This extension can read and change your data on sites**: The sites listed with this permission are used to retrieve data for CaretTab to function.
- **https://fonts.googleapis.com/***: The fonts available in the extension are from Google Fonts; this URL is where the fonts are loaded from.
- **Read the icons of the websites you visit**: Used to display the favicons (logos) of the website you add to your quick links.
- **Read a list of your most frequently visited websites**: Used to display the "most visited" menu on the quick links widget, when enabled.

3. Enable 'Developer Mode' by checking the tickbox (on the top of the page).
